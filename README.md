# simple-wasm-go
Simple wasm from golang


## Todo 
1. Executing multiple languages via wasm (Multiple language interoperabality)
2. Running Webgpu based applications from WASM {Leveraging GPU for complex computation}
3. Understanding WASM and WASI

## Use Cases 
1. Capturing inventory details (name, brand, etc.) and quantity of inventory in any store - Computation can be done at local GPU instead of pushing it to servers
2. Running small utilities (minifypdf, pdftoword, pdftext, ocr recognition, extract data from image, etc . )
3. 

## To be identified
1. What happens when code is written in Webgpu by leveraging the GPU Cores but the GPU doesnt exists?
2.
